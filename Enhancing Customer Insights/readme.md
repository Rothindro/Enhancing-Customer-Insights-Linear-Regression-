### Overview:
This project examines customer spending behavior through an analysis of a dataset that encompasses yearly expenditures across digital platforms, including both a website and a mobile app, alongside customer membership duration. The primary goal is to predict future spending patterns, offering insights that can support strategic decision-making for optimizing digital experiences. Ultimately, the findings will help inform potential areas of focus for enhancing customer engagement and maximizing spending.
